Task Two: Data Anonymisation

# Anonymise personal data within a data set
What you'll learn
	Understand the importance of data anonymization in protecting sensitive customer information.
	Learn various techniques for anonymizing data while preserving its utility.
	Comprehend the risks associated with linkage attacks on anonymized data.
What you'll do
	Anonymize the provided data set, ensuring the protection of personal details.
	Utilize anonymization techniques such as removing unnecessary columns, masking identifying information, and categorizing sensitive figures.
	Submit the anonymized data as a CSV file.

# Here is the background information on your task
For CBA and InsightSpark to continue with the data science vision, the data scientists at InsightSpark need to combine customer data with the transactional data from the supermarkets.

The customer data will come from the CBA mobile app. However, we cannot provide them with the raw data until it has been suitably anonymised to protect the identity of individuals in the data set.

It is your job to design a privacy pipeline to execute on the data set. This pipeline must anonynmise the data set while preserving useful information.

Data privacy is crucial in preventing linkage attacks. This attack is a way of recovering personal information about people from an anonymised data set. It’s a powerful technique that can be executed with even the smallest personal information. Review the following resource for more information about linkage attacks.

# Here is your task
This task focuses on anonymising a data set of sensitive customer information. You must preserve the utility and valuable information within the dataset while anonymising any personal or sensitive information. You can complete this exercise with any tool you wish, but we recommend using Excel or a spreadsheet program of your choice. You only need to submit the anonymised data set as a CSV file for your deliverable. Should you need help, visit the Data Anonymisation links in the Resources section.

Further details about this task are given below in an email from the team lead:

Hello,

I have provided you with a data set named “mobile_customers.csv.” This contains information about customers that have signed up for the mobile app in the last three years.

We need you to anonymise this data to hide personal details while preserving any useful information for the data scientists at InsightSpark.

Here are some examples of how you may anonymise a data set:
You could remove columns that don’t provide helpful information for analysis (e.g., names or credit card numbers).
You could mask any columns that can identify an individual (e.g., passport numbers or mobile numbers).
You could categorise personal figures (e.g., age and income) into a bracket rather than a specific number.

First, research the different techniques available for anonymising a data set. Then, edit the data set to create an anonymised data set as a CSV file. When finished, please submit this CSV file for me to review before we share it with InsightSpark.

Once you’ve completed your anonymisation, submit your CSV file below.
