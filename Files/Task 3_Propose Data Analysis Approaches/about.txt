Task Three: Propose Data Analysis Approaches

# Explore data insights that can be unlocked with social media
What you'll learn
	Understand the difference between structured and unstructured data, with a focus on unstructured data from social media.
	Explore the types of data that can be extracted using the Twitter API and the potential insights that can be derived from them.
	Gain knowledge about how to use Twitter data for business purposes and decision-making.
What you'll do
	Explore @CommBank Twitter account.
	Examine the Twitter API's data dictionary.
	Create a proposal outlining insights from @CommBank Twitter data for InsightSpark.

# Here is the background information on your task
There are many different types of data, such as images, tabular data, documents, Excel files, etc. However, data types broadly fall into two categories, structured data and unstructured data.

In the previous two tasks, you dealt with structured data. Structured data has a consistent structure (i.e., coming from a database with a consistent schema). For this task, you will be exploring the value we can unlock from unstructured data in the form of written tweets.

First, you’ll want to look at the type of data that you can scrape from the Twitter account by exploring the Twitter API. Then, you’ll propose some ways in which InsightSpark could extract insights from this data to enrich its database.

# Here is your task
Start by familiarising yourself with the “@CommBank Twitter Account” to see what information is publicly available.

When you’re comfortable with the Twitter interface, move forward and begin to look into the Twitter API. “Twitter API: Data Dictionary” will show you the types of information that you can scrape from Twitter automatically using a programming language like Python. “Twitter: Build for Business,” on the other hand, will provide you with insights into how this information can be used in a business environment.

Once you’ve familiarised yourself with the referenced resources, write a proposal that suggests ways that InsightSpark can use the available data on the @CommBank Twitter account to extract valuable insights. Then, submit your proposal in the text field below.

# Example Answer
Great work! Take a look at the example answer below to see how a professional would have attempted this task. Think about what you did well and how you can improve.

Example Answer:

Tweet data can unlock plenty of valuable information for businesses like CommBank. Here are a few ideas: 

Examine CommBank’s most popular tweets. Which tweets get the most engagement? Are there identifiable trends in when these tweets are posted? Are there any similar qualities about the text of the tweets themselves? This information can provide valuable marketing insight. 
Evaluate sentiment in CommBank’s Twitter replies and quote retweets. Are people generally reacting positively or negatively to various tweets? What can we learn about their reaction? 
Examine user tweets that directly mention CommBank.Is there positive or negative feedback that we can address? Can we summarise user opinion? 
Look at the relationships between views, likes, and reblogs for CommBank tweets. If there are tweets that get high views but low likes and reblogs, can we identify factors that make users more likely to interact? 
Explore the user profiles of accounts that interact with CommBank’s Twitter. Can we extract any marketing insight from this audience?
